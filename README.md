This repository, **Ansys_Projects**, contains a collection of finite element analysis (FEA) simulations performed using ANSYS, with a strong emphasis on the detailed structural analysis of **bolted joints**. In addition, it includes static structural problems involving simple models like beams and brackets. Each project demonstrates core mechanical concepts through realistic setups, including geometry preparation, boundary conditions, meshing strategies, and result interpretation. The goal is to provide clear, practical examples for learning and reference, especially for students and engineers working with structural FEA in ANSYS.
